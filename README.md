# KeepNote

This is a simple React.js app that allows the user to create and delete notes. The app was built as part of a learning process and showcases the use of components, state management, and common JavaScript operations.

## Installation and Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project to your local machine.<br>
    `git clone https://github.com/CiscoMerchan/keep_note_with_reactjs.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Once the app is running, you can create new notes by filling in the title and content fields and clicking the "Add" button. The notes will appear in a list below the input form. To delete a note, simply click on the "Delete" button next to it.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

This app was built using React.js, a popular front-end JavaScript library. Some of the main concepts and features showcased in the app include:

- Components: The app is divided into several reusable components, including the main App component, the Header, Footer, CreateNote, and Note components.
- State management: The notes array, which holds all created notes, is managed using the useState hook.
- Props: Data is passed between components using props, allowing for communication and data transfer.
- JavaScript operations: Common JavaScript operations are used throughout the app, including the spread operator, object construction and destructuring, and array methods like map and filter.

## Future Improvements

There are several ways in which this app could be improved and expanded upon. Some potential future improvements include:

- Adding the ability to edit notes
- Sorting the notes by date or title
- Adding authentication and user accounts to allow users to save and access their notes across devices
- Add a database to save the notes
